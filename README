V version 0.09
==============

This module uses stolen code from C<Module::Info> to find the location
and version of the specified module(s). It prints them and exit()s.

It works by definening C<import()> and is based on an idea from Michael Schwern
on the perl5-porters list. See the discussion:

L<http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2002-01/msg00760.html>
